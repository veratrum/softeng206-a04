Welcome to the README file for Namesayer 4.0!

Before you start using Namesayer you must have added a database of names. To do this add the corresponding .wav files to the userdata file in the main directory. Additionally a database may also be imported using the import screen.

The userdata directory is used to save the state of the application, as well as storing a text file which has all of the ratings for the current recordings of the application.



To run Namesayer open up the command terminal and run the following command

	>java -jar namesayer.jar
