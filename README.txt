Welcome to Namesayer 4.0!

We have included the .wav database in the `database` directory, so you don't need to add it yourself. User-generated recordings are saved in the `userdata` directory.

`metadata.xml` stores the states of each database. `database/metadata.xml` is generated from the .wav database the first time the application is run. If you would like to revert Namesayer and its database to their original state, you can delete all the files in the `database` directory including `metadata.xml`, copy the .wav database back in, and start the application again. `ratings.txt` is generated by Namesayer but does not serve a purpose within Namesayer. We chose to add it because you could use it to, for example, write a script to delete all the bad recordings.

Additionally databases may be imported/exported as zip archives using the import screen.

The help screen inside Namesayer provides more information on how to use the different interfaces.

To run Namesayer open up the command terminal and run the following command

	>java -jar namesayer.jar
